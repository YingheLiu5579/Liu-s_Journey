I am not a keen user of artificial intellegence in the past until a few months ago when ChatGPT went virus. I tried as people made tons of discussion around it, and it is scarily competent. Now I use it frequently for two purpose: translation and learning how to code.

ChatGPT makes me feel like it (she, he, them; whatever the pronoun is) really understand me. It can interpret the script as a native speaker, which non of my past experience with softwares had ever achieved. If you have read a post full of typo or inconsistent voice tone, it is probably the result of the combination of my original text with translation.

As for coding, I use ChatGPT when I don't know how to achieve a function. For instance, I need to add style to my website. I just directly ask AI what options are available, and then it would teach me with procedures. It saved my time to search online and filter out advertisements on feeds, despite I found sometimes posts somewhere such as Reddit may better address my problem. The embedded Copilot function in Rstudio is convinient as well. This function works perfect when th scaffold is already there.

I would not underestimate human brain, just thinking the great mankind who create AI makes me marvel. Yet I also see great potentials in such deep learning technique, for its unprecedented execution of human language. I now have no doubt AI would replace many jobs, and dramatically change my life. I don't know how it is going to affact me, my family, or anything I know about. The deeply rooted insecurity drives me embrace the usage of AI.

Sometimes I feel lucky that I was born in such a generation that I can witness the big changes in history, while sorry that I may not be the ones who benefit most from it. Every evolution in productivity must come with cost, and predictably more people will be replaced by integrative AI than ever. Maybe more jobs can be built on the new tech, but people in the ruins may never survive from the avalanche.

I am thus optimistic about the development of AI, and feeling the opposite for unlucky people not taking advantage of it. As part of the potential unfortunate population, I sometimes look forward to such future, where artificial intelligence is able to achieve more creativity and autonomy. I had this evilly prevailing thoughts that the best human can do is to create another more computationally superior species as part of "Earth Culture". The utopia is less untouchable, of course, with tears of history.

I had witnessed how AI changed one industry once. AI ruined my pleasure in discovering new patterns in the game of Go (refer to previous posts) along with a more objective standard in scaling. Back then, I would not imaging myself writing to record my random thoughts about it. Interesting to see how life changes.

I tried to use the GTPs store offered by OpenAI. It is still a limited service now, but still capable in making me a logo for this website. To my awareness, I am not sure whether such image might invade anyone's interest, so I won't use it. I would like to show everyone what it is like:
