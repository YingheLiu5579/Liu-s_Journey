    "text": "I was born in an ordinary small county town in central China, where I have four siblings and am the youngest. The children in our family come from different mothers, and only my older sister is close to my age. To provide better educational resources for the two of us, we moved to the nearest city, Luoyang. During the era of the one-child policy, each family was allowed only one child. Perhaps to cater to the traditional preference for boys over girls at that time, a family could have a second child if the first was a girl, which is why I was born.\nMy memories before the age of six are very vague. The earliest clear memory I have is of feeling alone and helpless at five years old, following behind my parents. It‚Äôs common for the earliest memories at this age to be negative. Another vivid memory is from first grade, when I cried in the classroom without my mother‚Äôs company. I was one of the youngest students in the class, in an era when there were no strict age requirements for school entry.\nLooking back, my primary school years were generally happy and carefree. I wasn‚Äôt an outstanding student, never the ‚Äúother people‚Äôs child‚Äù that teachers held up as an example. My biggest worries were being scolded by the teacher for not doing homework or having to attend tutoring classes after school. I had a few close friends then, with whom I‚Äôve since lost contact; perhaps they‚Äôve all started new and varied lives. I also experienced school bullying and witnessed domestic violence. It was the companionship of good friends and my mother that helped me through those times.\nMy middle school years were a period of self-discovery that I look back on fondly and wish I could experience again. I felt sexual attraction for the first time, had the first close friendship that lasted for years, traveled abroad for the first time, and experienced my first existential crisis about death. School was exciting, with new subjects to systematically learn, all waiting to be explored. Of course, I also recall numerous embarrassing moments from this period, which I wish I could erase from my memory.\nHigh school was traumatic. The first year was still filled with the joy of learning new things and making new friends, but the pressure of preparing for the college entrance exam (Gaokao, similar to SAT) starting in the second year overwhelmed me. I struggled to maintain interest in all subjects, which didn‚Äôt bode well for standardized tests. Meanwhile, as the one-child policy ended, my parents decided to have another child, a brother ten years younger than me. An unprecedented conflict erupted within the family when my mother‚Äôs postpartum depression collided with past issues. The combination of family breakdown and academic stress left me constantly questioning, ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù and many of my past aspirations shattered.\nThe Gaokao is so crucial in China, a single exam that can determine decades of your future. In the New Year before the Gaokao, I decided to give up on it and study abroad. Life experiences prompted me to reflect on thinking and behavior, wondering what thinking ability really is. I had the opportunity to go abroad and study subjects of interest, for which I‚Äôm especially grateful to my family for their understanding and support. My last year of high school was spent in uncertainty about the future.\nThe start of my college life coincided with the black swan event of the COVID-19 pandemic. I had to stay in China during my first year and went to the United States just before the Delta variant outbreak in 2021. My second year was also spent masked, with early college courses mostly being general education classes, leaving me few credits to choose subjects I was interested in. During these two years, I adapted to a new culture and learned about psychology. I finally had my own space to rebuild the future and life I wanted. After gaining a deeper understanding of my areas of interest, I decided to actively engage in academic research, starting with basic data collection in a research group during the summer of my junior year.\nAs of early 2024, my life is still very uncertain. I am trying to find a job that allows me to stay in academia, while also considering other possibilities. My first two decades were full of exploration, and I hope to continue challenging myself in the future."

A personal website helps me concentrate on consolidating the contents and organizing my thoughts.\nI tried many social media platforms such as Twitter or Weibo, yet sooner I realized the content provided by these social media distract me from creating considered outputs. They become more likely a place for me to consume information and interact with others. The feeds are rich, diverse, and sometimes overwhelming. Thus, I decided to build a more freestanding place for publishing. I said to myself:‚ÄúTime to engage with the world, and share your thoughts with others.‚Äù\nI was concerned about to what extend should I share my personal life. I am not sure if I should share my personal life stories, or just focus on the professional side. Would personal details scarify privacy and security? Would it be too much to share? I am still not sure about the answer, but I will try to balance the two sides.\nThe blogs are not serious output of arguements.

    "text": "I am not a keen user of artificial intellegence in the past until a few months ago when ChatGPT went virus. I tried as people made tons of discussion around it, and it is scarily competent. Now I use it frequently for two purpose: translation and learning how to code.\nChatGPT makes me feel like it (she, he, them; whatever the pronoun is) really understand me. It can interpret the script as a native speaker, which non of my past experience with softwares had ever achieved. If you have read a post full of typo or inconsistent voice tone, it is probably the result of the combination of my original text with translation.\nAs for coding, I use ChatGPT when I don‚Äôt know how to achieve a function. For instance, I need to add style to my website. I just directly ask AI what options are available, and then it would teach me with procedures. It saved my time to search online and filter out advertisements on feeds, despite I found sometimes posts somewhere such as Reddit may better address my problem. The embedded Copilot function in Rstudio is convinient as well. This function works perfect when th scaffold is already there.\nI would not underestimate human brain, just thinking the great mankind who create AI makes me marvel. Yet I also see great potentials in such deep learning technique, for its unprecedented execution of human language. I now have no doubt AI would replace many jobs, and dramatically change my life. I don‚Äôt know how it is going to affact me, my family, or anything I know about. The deeply rooted insecurity drives me embrace the usage of AI.\nSometimes I feel lucky that I was born in such a generation that I can witness the big changes in history, while sorry that I may not be the ones who benefit most from it. Every evolution in productivity must come with cost, and predictably more people will be replaced by integrative AI than ever. Maybe more jobs can be built on the new tech, but people in the ruins may never survive from the avalanche.\nI am thus optimistic about the development of AI, and feeling the opposite for unlucky people not taking advantage of it. As part of the potential unfortunate population, I sometimes look forward to such future, where artificial intelligence is able to achieve more creativity and autonomy. I had this evilly prevailing thoughts that the best human can do is to create another more computationally superior species as part of ‚ÄúEarth Culture‚Äù. The utopia is less untouchable, of course, with tears of history.\nI had witnessed how AI changed one industry once. AI ruined my pleasure in discovering new patterns in the game of Go (refer to previous posts) along with a more objective standard in scaling. Back then, I would not imaging myself writing to record my random thoughts about it. Interesting to see how life changes.\n\n\nJan 16, 2024 Updates\nI tried to use the GTPs store offered by OpenAI. It is still a limited service now, but still capable in making me a logo for this website. To my awareness, I am not sure whether such image might invade anyone‚Äôs interest, so I won‚Äôt use it.

    "text": "After acquiring the new Steam Deck OLED, my device finally has enough performance to run some larger games, among which The Witcher 3 and Elden Ring have been the most addictive for me. Additionally, I‚Äôve tried many multiplayer games with FEI, but the quality of these games varies greatly.\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \nThe Witcher 3 has been in my library for a year, but my previous gameplay experience was limited to the tutorial due to insufficient device performance. The new device motivated me to try it again on a new platform. I spent about fifty hours around the Christmas holiday to complete the main storyline of The Witcher 3, stopping just before the last stop of Ciri‚Äôs journey. Having already seen the plot in the Netflix series, I lost interest in the game‚Äôs storyline and had little expectation for the ‚Äúfinding the daughter‚Äù plot development. I even bought the DLC, but it might wait until the next holiday to be played.\nI really like the world structure of The Witcher 3 - vast and well-crafted. The most interesting part of the gameplay is the freedom to make choices that affect the story‚Äôs progression. I chose to protect everyone around me as much as possible, with the most challenging decision being in the Heart of the Tree quest, where I kept reloading saves to try different outcomes. The combat isn‚Äôt very challenging at normal difficulty, which is friendly for someone like me who struggles with FPS games. Exploring the map and clearing question marks is addictive. However, as a classic game released years ago, I encountered issues like rough model rendering, which might be considered a downside.\nThe Elden Ring\nThe Elden Ring is incredibly fun and very much to my taste! I‚Äôve been engrossed for nearly a hundred hours, and that‚Äôs just on my first run. I‚Äôm only left with the final boss, the Elden Beast, to complete the main storyline. The design of this last boss is somewhat frustrating; as a melee berserker, I had to turn into a walking simulator, and I hope I won‚Äôt get stuck in the next few days.\nThe absence of excessive tutorials and storylines is great! I dislike when narrative takes precedence over gameplay, forcing me to focus on the main story. In the Elden Ring, I can freely explore the map and choose quests. Gradually piecing together hidden stories by exploring and interpreting texts is rewarding. The combat system, with its variety of weapons like two-handed, one-handed, shields, magic, bows, and even fists, is fantastic. I chose berserker without any spoilers, which was challenging. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying different builds, perhaps a noble mage in my next run. The variety of prayers and summons also satisfies my curiosity.\n Memes draw from IGN. Unique notes system allows players to leave messages for others. Sometimes the messages are helpful only in certain language context.\nHowever, there are drawbacks. The game‚Äôs exquisite graphics, wallpaper-worthy screenshots, demand high performance; my Steam Deck can only maintain 30-40 FPS, and I experience graphic tearing when moving fast. Another issue is the game‚Äôs unchangeable difficulty level. Although I appreciate not having to choose a difficulty, the strict death penalty might deter some players. As a fan of rogue-like games, this isn‚Äôt a big problem for me.\nPortal 2\nAn unimaginable masterpiece!I didn‚Äôt have high expectations at first, considering it‚Äôs an older game from over a decade ago. But its reputation and being a Valve product made me give it a try. With a backdrop of overwhelmingly positive reviews, I was astounded by the game‚Äôs design.\nSmooth is how I describe my gameplay experience. With fine graphics and fluid motion, there was no lag. Unlike older games with rough modeling, like The Witcher 3, Portal 2 demonstrated what a benchmark in the industry looks like. The core game design, built into its name, is amazing. Constantly using portals to traverse spaces and solve puzzles was an incredible experience. The most unbelievable part is the physics engine - how such a smooth experience was created is beyond me.\nI even hesitated to play further, as each bit of game content consumed made me feel a sense of loss. With its affordable price, low system requirements, excellent graphics, and brilliant game concept, Portal 2 is perhaps the most recommendable game I‚Äôve ever encountered.\nEnd Note\nThese are the three most recommendable games from my Christmas holiday gaming experience. They‚Äôre all worth spending time on. If I don‚Äôt update my blog frequently, I‚Äôm probably immersed in these games. Stay tuned for updates on other games I‚Äôve experienced."

    "text": "Holidays, as a societal tradition, are often imbued with specific meanings, perhaps to commemorate a person or a significant event. However, those familiar with me know that I don‚Äôt celebrate holidays; I only observe vacations because, to me, every day holds no particular ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù. I simply appreciate the free time and don‚Äôt assign any special meaning to it. In fact, the two words I dislike the most are ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù and ‚Äúproof,‚Äù as they both carry broad and intricate connotations. I believe that ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport‚Äù are often better expressions in most contexts. Perhaps one day, I will write a blog post to share my philosophical viewpoints.\nNow, back to the topic of holidays, why do I choose to plan and reflect at the beginning of a new year, which seems contradictory to my previous narrative? It‚Äôs challenging to describe the subtle shift in my mindset, perhaps it‚Äôs the change in the date on my phone‚Äôs lock screen, going from a number I‚Äôve been accustomed to for hundreds of days to a new and unavoidable one. This artificial categorization reminds me that my vacation balance is running low, prompting anxiety and leading me to review the past year. Another reason is the upcoming new semester, during which I might struggle to find spare time for relaxation.\nMy most noticeable perception is the decline in my physical condition over the past months. From June to September, I maintained vigorous exercise for at least two hours per week, but by the end of the year, I felt exhausted every day, even lacking the motivation to go grocery shopping. This change was gradual, and perhaps it was one day in October when certain circumstances disrupted my exercise routine, leading to a gradual decline. Oh, I remember now, I got infected with COVID-19 during the seasonal transition from autumn to winter, which caused me to abandon my previous routine. I hope that in the coming year, I can regain a rhythm of exercise, at least maintaining a certain biological rhythm.\nAs for interpersonal relationships, most of my time is still invested in a friendship that has lasted for four years, with FEI accompanying me through countless days and nights. Other friends from before college only occasionally exchange holiday greetings, while most of them remain silently in my contact list, a testament to the passage of time. Sometimes, I suddenly miss some past experiences and have the urge to greet old friends, but considering I have no plans to return home in the near future, I can only reluctantly give up. I‚Äôd rather not bring disappointment. I have also made some new friends, most of whom are classmates at school. Apart from that, my parents still call me regularly, and I sometimes share life‚Äôs hardships with my sister. There has been no progress in romantic relationships, and I continue to enjoy my single life. Maintaining interpersonal relationships is difficult to force, and purposefully pursuing them can be exhausting. Being single is truly enjoyable!üòù\nIn academics, I have made significant breakthroughs. At the beginning of the year, I set academic research as a long-term plan for the next few years and identified areas of interest. I maintained my performance in courses and began reading some literature. I must admit that some of the literature is challenging to read, and some of the vocabulary remains my biggest reading obstacle. But as I became familiar with the structure of academic literature, I no longer resisted reading. I also joined two research groups, and the process of behavioral science research turned out to be simpler than I had imagined. I deeply admire the genius experimental designs and concepts. I also attempted to take on the responsibility of a TA, but unfortunately, limited by my own knowledge, I didn‚Äôt help the students in that course much, and I feel deeply responsible for that.\nAcademics will be a significant focus for the next period. I deliberately gave up the application window at the end of 2023 because I am not yet qualified to be a Ph.D.¬†student. In the coming weeks, I will refine my proposal on EDA repeatability and seek support. Additionally, I will try to find a position to stay in academia, which is another headache. I hope to find a research group that interests me and is willing to take me in ü•π."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I begin my practice with electrodermal activity data (EDA) from a project named Parent Regulation, Engagement, Stress, and Health (PRESH) Study. The study is lead by professor Lunkenheimer and administered in Penn State. I am a research assistant that helps with data collection, a job common for a undergraduate.\nThe PRESH study aims to investigate the relationship between parent-child interaction and children‚Äôs health. More specifically, the study focuses on how the parent-child reaction pattern reacts with disciplinary practices. In conceptual terms, the study is interested in how parent and child‚Äôs physiological reaction to each other and disciplinary practices within th framework of laboratory settings. Parents and children are asked to perform a series of tasks, including the Parent-Child Challenge Task (PCCT) and the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). We collect Heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory rate in both PCCT and TSST. In this post, I will focus on EDA data.\n\nPCCT is a 15-minute task that includes a free play, a challenging puzzle task, and a clean-up task. The free play is designed to observe how parents and children interact with each other in a naturalistic, less stressful setting; the puzzle task is intentioanlly above the child‚Äôs ability to solve at the age of three, while clean-up task provides us an opportunity to peak into potential conflicts between parents and children that might lead to disciplinary practices. Overall, PCCT enables a contextual observation of parent-child interaction.\n\n\nTSST is a well-established stress-inducing task that focuses more on how one individual reacts to stress. The a 10-minute task contains a five-minute a five-minute speech and a five-minute math task. Just image that you are asked to give a speech in front of a group of people and then do some math problems without any feeedback from the interviewer. The stressful paradigm leads to stress-related response, such as physiological arousal and behavioral regulation.\n\nAs part of physio team in the PRESH study, I am responsible for EDA data cleaning but not later-on analysis. We separate the data collection staff and data analysis staff to avoid potential bias. I do not have much experience with EDA data, so I am learning from the very beginning. My first question is: what is EDA?\n\nElectrodermal activity (EDA) refers to small changes in the electrical activity of the skin, usually occurring 1‚Äì3 seconds following the onset of a stimulus. Since the late 19th century, it has been recognized as a useful measurement to estimate human emotional responses, especially under stressful situations. Historically, it has had many past names, such as sympathetic skin response (SSR) or skin conductance level (SCL). The term EDA is now used to refer to the entire electrodermal phenomenon, including both tonic and phasic components.\n\nMy training began in the early June of 2023. I was given a brief introduction of EDA and the data collection process and then taught how to use the software to clean the EDA data. Physio data are not always immediately usable and require cleaning based on raw data. The complexity of cleaning process depends on the type of data, varying dramatically from one to another. For example, EDA data are impacted by many artifacts, while heart rate data are relatively less demanding and less time-consuming.\nHere is the overall workflow of EDA data cleaning:\n\n\n\nEDA data cleaning workflow\n\n\nWe followed guidelines provided by out technique support MindWare. But the guidelines are not always clear and easy to follow. I will share my experience and practice in the following sections. A typical EDA cleaning process of one file (one parent and one child) takes me about 40 to 60 minutes. For messy files that require more attention, it can take up to 80 minutes. The cleaning process is time-consuming because we need to go through the entire file and check for artifacts. Once a file is editted, we update the result with the group and decide whether a doubling-edit is needed. EDA data are sensitive to artifacts, so we need to be careful with the cleaning process. We are aware of the potential bias introduced by the cleaning process, so we are trying to minimize the impact of cleaning process on the final result. Thus, we are trying to be as objective as possible by assigning the same raw data to different group memeber and compare the results.\nI editted more than 30 files for the last few months, and am still learning and improving my skills. I will demonstrate my effort in quality control and issues we encountered during data cleaning in the following posts."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe slides are from a final semester project, so it is intentianally brief for time sake. For more detailed information about how I learned about EDA and some effort I‚Äôve made to improve reproducibility, refer to some other posts.\nSlide 1 & 2: Topic Intro/What is EDA\nElectrodermal activity (EDA) refers to small changes in the electrical activity of the skin, usually occurring 1‚Äì3 seconds following the onset of a stimulus 1. Since the late 19th century, it has been recognized as a useful measurement to estimate human emotional responses, especially under stressful situations. Historically, it has had many past names, such as sympathetic skin response (SSR) or skin conductance level (SCL). 2 They may not all follow the same measurement paradigm, but all conceptualize targeting sweat secretion.\nSlide 3: Mechanisms of EDA\nOverall, we can explain EDA using an information processing system model that contains Input, Information Process, and Output. When an outside stressor generates some stimulation (Input), the signals then pass down to the CNS for further processing. The outcome is executed by the peripheral system, or more specifically, the autonomic system, which controls sweat glands to produce more secretion, resulting in changes in skin surface conductivity. We have learned from past courses that such a mechanism may represent evolutionary adaptations to mobilize body resources to respond to challenging events.\nThe picture on the right illustrates how we measure EDA by attaching electrodes to the palms. Palms, rather than areas under the arms, are more sensitive to stressors, but may not be the best measurement loci. Fingertips, instead, are now found to be the more recommended loci.3 We have decided to remain consistent with our manual that still uses palm loci. In addition to palms, electrodes may also be attached to the chest cavity to measure respiration rate and heart rate. As discussed later, these measurements are usually coupled together to ensure the convergence of autonomic system responses. 4\nSlide 4: Who uses EDA?\nEDA is widely used in the following psychology-related areas:\n‚Ä¢ Emotion Research: Investigating how individuals react to emotional stimuli, such as images, videos, or emotional experiences. 5\n‚Ä¢ Stress and Anxiety Studies: How individuals react in stressful situations. 6\n‚Ä¢ Affective Computing and Interactions (My case)\n‚Ä¢ Pain Perception\n‚Ä¢ Biofeedback in PNS\n‚Ä¢ Marketing and Consumer Behavior: How people react to marketing stimuli, even used in tourism. 7\n‚Ä¢ Clinical Application: Anxiety-related Disorders/Traumatic experiences: Used in clinical psychology and psychiatry to assess physiological responses in individuals with conditions such as anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and phobias. 8\nSlide 5 & 6: Paradigm Examples\nIn my case, we use the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to create tension by asking them to pretend to be an interview candidate.9 The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) investigates how people make decisions and conduct risky behaviors. 10 Lie Detector Tests (Polygraph Examinations) are the first time I have heard of this technique. In this test, people react to questions that evoke considerable emotional responses.\nFrom one of our past coursework, we learned about some platforms that share protocols. The figure shown in the slide is a screenshot of TSST from Protocol.io.11 We can see some interesting descriptions: ‚ÄúHeart rate, EDA, and respiration rate are assessed continuously,‚Ä¶, [and] participants are asked to abstain from ‚Ä¶, smoking, using substances, ‚Ä¶, engaging in physical exercise‚Ä¶‚Äù Some factors are very intuitive, such as physical exercise, and were realized by early researchers, but others were gradually learned in the following decades. 12\nHere, the reproducibility crisis emerges. For instance, an early dataset may not exclude smoking as artifacts, whereas later datasets benefit from recent studies and remove smoking-related skin conductance responses. This usually shows up as different criteria in manuals. Another good example would be loci choice, as discussed previously.\nSlide 7 & 8: Basic Properties\nAs shown in the picture, it takes about 1 to 3 seconds for skin conductance to occur. The latency is the state where our body receives the stimuli, processes the information, and generates reactions. The amplitude is how dramatically the sweat glands secrete accordingly.\nThe picture in slide 8 shows two major components of EDA data: tonic and phasic. The tonic component refers to the non-specific, steadily changing rhythms of the autonomic nervous system, and the phasic component refers to event-related responses that most studies target. They are vital in controlling variables.\nSlide 9 & 10: Influencing Factors\nEDA is complex because it involves many influencing factors. The major ones are technique, environment, and individual differences. Technique factors range from electrode materials to measured loci; environmental factors include temperature and humidity; individual differences encompass drugs, exercise, respiration, age, and skin water content. 13Among all factors, we can control technique, environment, skin water content, drugs, and exercise status, but some individual factors are not subject to laboratory settings. The most commonly seen uncontrolled factors are respiration, connection stability, miscellaneous actions such as sudden movement, and pressing electrodes. On top of this, we need to delete falsely marked skin conductivity responses resulting from software settings.\nSlide 11 & 12: Artifacts Demonstration\nIllustrations of irregular respiration and pressing on the sensor as artifacts.\nIrregular respiration may lead to sudden changes in EDA value, with few standardized methods that can rule out these artifacts. 14\nSlide 13 & 14: Cognitive Bias\nIn practice, I realized that EDA editing is under the threat of cognitive bias. This is primarily because of the ambiguity in describing artifacts, such as respiration. We consider ‚Äú2 to 3 times larger than the average‚Äù as irregular, but finding the average may be highly subject to human error. The pictures I show in the slides are two examples where we have trouble identifying the average respiration rate of a task. A messy file part in the earlier half may change how editors value the rest half.\nSlide 15: Efforts towards Open Science\nWe have implemented some quality assurance processes to protect our results from cognitive bias. Firstly, we decided to double-edit files that might be controversial. By introducing a second editor, we can provide more diversified interpretative perspectives and correct the misuse of editorial manuals by a single editor. Then we labeled all major artifacts with a code, as shown on the right slide. Any modification made to the raw data would be recorded with the ‚ÄúType-Time‚Äù abbreviation so that we can track all objective decisions. Additionally, I also use programming languages to make the generation of double-edit files and the transfer of data more replicable. If the EDA data in the study I engage in were eventually openly shared, I would have at least the confidence to speak of ‚Äúan attempt towards open science.‚Äù\nSlide 16: Many-Analyst Approach\nIn fact, the ambulatory EDA setting has raised some concerns in the last decade.1516, but no study has quantitatively assessed how dramatically human-led measurement errors can be affected by standardized manuals in an ambiguous setting. Thus, I designed a study that uses a many-analyst approach to estimate how editors from different backgrounds act on the same raw EDA data.\nEditors will be provided with raw datasets from a standardized test such as TSST for analysis. Other coupled variables used during assessment are also included, including heart rate variance, impedance, and respiration rate. Any manipulation of the dataset would be recorded by a unified coding system, such as ‚ÄúType-Time‚Äù abbreviations. Editors would be required to share their applied manuals, which would be provided by a third-party or originated by the editors. Ultimately, the overlap of the results could be estimated by comparing different data processing results. In our in-group trial where editors used the same manual and were trained by the instructor concurrently, we achieved an 88 percent consistency rate.\nFor more information about how we achieved the preliminary results, please refer to the other blog to be posted soon."

    "text": "I spent the first eighteen years of my life in a small city in central China, where educational resources were limited, and everyone was striving for the opportunity to move to bigger cities. Standardized exams acted as ruthless filters, stifling individual exploration and creativity. During my high school years, I continually pondered what kind of person I was and explored various philosophical viewpoints. The exploration of thinking itself fascinated me, and eventually, I chose psychology as my undergraduate major.\nIn the Chinese context, psychology is a vast concept, and I didn‚Äôt understand what studying psychological phenomena systematically entailed. During my first two years in college, I explored different courses in psychology. These courses were all intriguing, but most importantly, they helped me realize that psychology is an empirical discipline. The psychological perspective that intrigued me the most was viewing psychological phenomena from cognitive and individual development perspectives. No cognitive phenomenon arises out of thin air; it is based on biological structures. Moreover, over time, our cognition is continually shaped.\nIn the vast realm of psychology, the ‚Äúchess study‚Äù caught my attention. This resonated with my passion for board games, and you can find more specific details in the articles I share on my blog. ‚ÄúExecutive function‚Äù is at the core of the research, but most undergraduate education provides general knowledge and is insufficient to answer all questions comprehensively. Therefore, in my junior year, I decided to further my education and seek more knowledge about ‚Äúexecutive function.‚Äù\nI was fortunate to have the opportunity to explore the academic world during the summer break of my junior year. I first joined the PRESH project led by Professor Lunkenheimer at Penn State. The research group focused on how parents and children interact and whether this parent-child relationship is influenced by the parents‚Äô own experiences. A classic scenario was teaching children to manage their behavior, and the research group set up a simulated daily interaction laboratory setting for this purpose. My role in this project was to collect Electrodermal Activity (EDA) data, and I have written several blog posts analyzing the challenges we faced regarding EDA data.\nI also joined another research group at Penn State, led by Professor Gilmore. His research focused on two major areas: the early developmental curve of human vision and the issue of replicability. One significant reason I joined this group was my realization of the importance of data collection in psychological research and the challenges encountered in practice, such as EDA. My task was to create a handbook for a data-sharing platform to make it easier for people to share data. This information platform, dedicated to developmental psychology, is called Databrary.\nAt the same time, I attempted to design research from the perspective of a data analyst to provide more evidence about the challenges of EDA replicability, but progress has been slow. My current goal is to finalize the proposal by the end of January and seek further guidance.\n\nCheck these posts to know about my academic passion!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Game of Go\n\n\nThoughts on the game of Go from a ten-year player.\n\n\n\nYinghe Liu\n\n\nJan 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Practice of Electrodermal Activity Data (EDA).\n\n\nShare my practice of electrodermal activity data.\n\n\n\nYinghe Liu\n\n\nDec 29, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing Reproducibility of Electrodermal Activity Data (EDA).\n\n\nDiscuss to what impacts consistent results of EDA\n\n\n\nYinghe Liu\n\n\nJan 8, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
