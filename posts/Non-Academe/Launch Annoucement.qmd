After two weeks of preparation, the website is now available to the public!!! I have to confess I stop working on the website for a while because I was busy with "The elden ring" and "The Witcher 3". But now I am back to work and I will try to update the website as often as possible. 

**What's next**

I will try to add more content to the website and enable google analytics so that people can locate the website by search engine. Currently, I am still adapting the new semester. I will be focusing on finishing the rest content of "my lifestory" and "EDA-related posts".
