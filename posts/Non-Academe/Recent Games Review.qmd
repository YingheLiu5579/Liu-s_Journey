After acquiring the new Steam Deck OLED, my device finally has enough performance to run some larger games, among which The Witcher 3 and Elden Ring have been the most addictive for me. Additionally, I've tried many multiplayer games with FEI, but the quality of these games varies greatly.

**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**

The Witcher 3 has been in my library for a year, but my previous gameplay experience was limited to the tutorial due to insufficient device performance. The new device motivated me to try it again on a new platform. I spent about fifty hours around the Christmas holiday to complete the main storyline of The Witcher 3, stopping just before the last stop of Ciri's journey. Having already seen the plot in the Netflix series, I lost interest in the game's storyline and had little expectation for the "finding the daughter" plot development. I even bought the DLC, but it might wait until the next holiday to be played.

I really like the world structure of The Witcher 3 - vast and well-crafted. The most interesting part of the gameplay is the freedom to make choices that affect the story's progression. I chose to protect everyone around me as much as possible, with the most challenging decision being in the Heart of the Tree quest, where I kept reloading saves to try different outcomes. The combat isn't very challenging at normal difficulty, which is friendly for someone like me who struggles with FPS games. Exploring the map and clearing question marks is addictive. However, as a classic game released years ago, I encountered issues like rough model rendering, which might be considered a downside.

**The Elden Ring**

The Elden Ring is incredibly fun and very much to my taste! I've been engrossed for nearly a hundred hours, and that's just on my first run. I'm only left with the final boss, the Elden Beast, to complete the main storyline. The design of this last boss is somewhat frustrating; as a melee berserker, I had to turn into a walking simulator, and I hope I won't get stuck in the next few days.

The absence of excessive tutorials and storylines is great! I dislike when narrative takes precedence over gameplay, forcing me to focus on the main story. In the Elden Ring, I can freely explore the map and choose quests. Gradually piecing together hidden stories by exploring and interpreting texts is rewarding. The combat system, with its variety of weapons like two-handed, one-handed, shields, magic, bows, and even fists, is fantastic. I chose berserker without any spoilers, which was challenging. I'm looking forward to trying different builds, perhaps a noble mage in my next run. The variety of prayers and summons also satisfies my curiosity.

However, there are drawbacks. The game's exquisite graphics, wallpaper-worthy screenshots, demand high performance; my Steam Deck can only maintain 30-40 FPS, and I experience graphic tearing when moving fast. Another issue is the game's unchangeable difficulty level. Although I appreciate not having to choose a difficulty, the strict death penalty might deter some players. As a fan of rogue-like games, this isn't a big problem for me.

**Portal 2**

An unimaginable **masterpiece**!I didn't have high expectations at first, considering it's an older game from over a decade ago. But its reputation and being a Valve product made me give it a try. With a backdrop of overwhelmingly positive reviews, I was astounded by the game's design.

Smooth is how I describe my gameplay experience. With fine graphics and fluid motion, there was no lag. Unlike older games with rough modeling, like The Witcher 3, Portal 2 demonstrated what a benchmark in the industry looks like. The core game design, built into its name, is amazing. Constantly using portals to traverse spaces and solve puzzles was an incredible experience. The most unbelievable part is the physics engine - how such a smooth experience was created is beyond me.

I even hesitated to play further, as each bit of game content consumed made me feel a sense of loss. With its affordable price, low system requirements, excellent graphics, and brilliant game concept, Portal 2 is perhaps the most recommendable game I've ever encountered.

**End Note**

These are the three most recommendable games from my Christmas holiday gaming experience. They're all worth spending time on. ~~If I don't update my blog frequently, I'm probably immersed in these games.~~ Stay tuned for updates on other games I've experienced.
