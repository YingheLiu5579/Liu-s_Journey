Welcome! This is my first blog post. At the end of 2023, blog seems to be out of fashion, but I still want to build up a place where I can share my thoughts and life stories. A personal website helps me concentrate on consolidating the contents and organizing my thoughts.

I tried many social media platforms such as Twitter or Weibo, yet sooner I realized the content provided by these social media distract me from creating considered outputs. They become more likely a place for me to consume information and interact with others. The feeds are rich, diverse, and sometimes overwhelming. Thus, I decided to build a more freestanding place for publishing. I said to myself:"Time to engage with the world, and share your thoughts with others."

I was concerned about to what extend should I share my personal life. I am not sure if I should share my personal life stories, or just focus on the professional side. Would personal details scarify privacy and security? Would it be too much to share? I am still not sure about the answer, but I will try to balance the two sides.

The blogs are **not** serious output of arguments. You will probably read two types of language tone, one by my written in English and another one translated from Chinese. I use mostly ChatGPT for this purpose, shamefully I may never be able to write so authentically in English as AI does. If you have any idea after reading my blogs, help me learn moreðŸ¥¹! ! You may also reach me via email, discord, or even steam. I am always open to new ideas and thoughts.
