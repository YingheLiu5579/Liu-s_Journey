1. Wechat share button [Unsolved]
Wechat disabled the Javascript hyperlink sharing function. I need to figure out a way to share my blog to Wechat. It seems that I am forced to use the Wechat QR code to share my blog.

2. Render the website [Solved]
Something went wrong when I tried to render the website. It is stuck in one of my past version of the webcite, yet once I clicked the `Liu's Journey` page, the problem disappeared. I am not sure what happened. I will keep an eye on it.

Dec 31 2023 Update: I figured out the problem in the quarto official guideline. The `Freeze` function is used during rendering. Add `Freeze: True` to force rendering.
