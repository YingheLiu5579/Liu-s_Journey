::: callout-warning
This is likely a place for me to spill the beans on the struggles within the web developmentü§¨.
:::

1.  Wechat share button \[Unsolved\] Wechat disabled the Javascript hyperlink sharing function. I need to figure out a way to share my blog to Wechat. It seems that I am forced to use the Wechat QR code to share my blog. ~~"Âº†Â∞èÈæôÔºå\_\_\_\_"~~

2.  Render the website \[Solved\] Something went wrong when I tried to render the website. It is stuck in one of my past version of the webcite, yet once I clicked the `Liu's Journey` page, the problem disappeared. I am not sure what happened. I will keep an eye on it.

Dec 31 2023 Update: I figured out the problem in the quarto official guideline. The `Freeze` function is used during rendering. Add `Freeze: True` to force rendering.

3.  Comments on Website \[Unsolved\] I need to figure out a way to add comments on my website.

4.  RSS Feed \[Unsolved\]

I met a problem when I tried to push my website to Github. I got the following error message:
