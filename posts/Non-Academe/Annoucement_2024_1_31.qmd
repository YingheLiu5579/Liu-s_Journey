My update frequency would be lower than before, because I am currently focusing on coursework and job applications. My next step for this blog website would be finishing data cleaning and visualization of EDA data and then publishing the file-porting-system withn the following month. The originated goal of many-analyst proposal would be on pending until I finished the file-porting-system, same case as of reference list for the Go blog.

Next post would be: *EDA data Visualization*, expected date: *2024-2-15*.
